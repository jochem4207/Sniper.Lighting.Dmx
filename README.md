# My purpose for this repo 
Creating a better audio-to-dmx software
To 
- Create lightshow on music
- A better sound to dmx for my home setup

Using
- hardware: Enttec dmx pro interface (MK1) 
- software: QLC+ webapi (suggestion of the facebook group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/lightingtrainer/?fref=nf)

End goals
- Traktor pro 3 to <my open custom software> to dmx 
- Document most steps so it can help people in the future
- Make a video how to use
  
# Steps to go

- [x] Make a plan
- [ ] Create a C# App (api, tbd) that can talk with QLC+
- [ ] Create sequences in QLC+ to be called from the web api
- [ ] Test the sound functions of QLC+
- [ ] If needed develop something as input for the C# App based on sound input 

# History
- Tried this repo, didn't work, no signals were actually send (see https://github.com/agrath/Sniper.Lighting.Dmx/issues/4)
- Tried QuickQ, MagicQ, seem far to complex
- Tried SoundSwitch, has no sound 2 dmx (lovely software tho)
- Tried FreeStyler with Sound 2 dmx, is only sending random dmx signals, i need more control. Good stuff if you want random dmx.
