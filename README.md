# History
- Tried this repo, didn't work, no signals were actually send (see https://github.com/agrath/Sniper.Lighting.Dmx/issues/4)
- Tried QuickQ, MagicQ, seem far to complex
- Tried SoundSwitch, has no sound 2 dmx (lovely software tho)
- Tried FreeStyler with Sound 2 dmx, is only sending random dmx signals, i need more control. Good stuff if you want random dmx.
